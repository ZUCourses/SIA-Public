Sports can be considered random systems due to elements of chance and luck, serving as a fun playground for probability and statistics analyses. Any statistics inferred about players or teams require probabilities obtained through empirical evidence. For this purpose, there is a location-based task: you will attend a sporting event in the city or watch one on TV and obtain some simple data through observation. Together with the set problems below, you should be inspired to perform your own probability analysis based on the data.\n",
